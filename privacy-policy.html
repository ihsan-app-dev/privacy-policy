Privacy Policy for Ihsan Night Calculator App
Last updated: [18th October 2023]

Introduction
At Ihsan, we prioritize your privacy. The term 'Ihsan' originates from Arabic, meaning 'excellence' - and we strive to achieve excellence not only in our services but also in maintaining the trust you place in us. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information. By using our app, you agree to the terms laid out in this policy.

Information We Collect
The primary piece of information our app collects is your location data. This data is vital for fetching accurate prayer times based on your geographical position.

How We Use Your Information
Your location data is used exclusively for the purpose of fetching accurate prayer times from an external API. It aids in providing specific functionalities such as calculating parts of the Islamic/Hijri night, such as the first third, second third, last third, and midnight.

Sharing with Third Parties
Your location data is transmitted to an external API to fetch prayer times. However, based on our understanding and the information provided by the API provider, this data is not stored or used beyond this specific functionality by the third parties. Simply put, while your location is used to request prayer times, it isn't saved or further utilized by the API provider.

Security
We are committed to ensuring your information is secure. We employ suitable technical measures to protect your data and ensure it isn't accessed in unauthorized ways.

Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
